This is a Guitar Chord Recognition Model which uses OpenCV, MediaPipe , Scikit-Learn and various other libraries to detect the chord "G","D","C".
The chord set is limited because first I manually recorded the dataset using MediaPipe and OpenCV and stored it in a CSV file.
I then used this dataset to train my model with a 94% accuracy and hence succeeding in my goal.
